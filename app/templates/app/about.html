                        Its really easy to get your object printed with our online print request system. 
                        Here are the steps:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Obtain the digital design of  the object either through CAD software or from Thingiverse.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Request a print using the link provided below.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We send you the cost of printing your object that you agree to.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Give us at least 48 hours to print your object. Only upon delivery of the object do we ask for payment.
                        </li>                    
                    </ol>

                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <h4>Professionalism</h4>
                    <p>The quality of your 3D print is our primary concern and we strive to produce parts that need no further finishing processes.</p>
                    <p>Rest assured, we will print out objects that are true to the form and dimensions defined in the digital design; as accurate as 0.02mm in some cases.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <h4>Personalized approach</h4>
                    <p>From the versatility of the process, every print request is different and everyone has their own preferences and tolerances.</p>
                    <p>We therefore love to hear you out so that we get as much information as is needed to produce the object as you intended it to be.</p>
