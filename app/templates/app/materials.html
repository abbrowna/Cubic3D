                3D printing materials are generally thermoplastics which means they can be reworked and reshaped on application of heat without degrading them. 
                They vary in properties which would make one material more suited to an application than the others.

                For a more indepth comparison between these 3 materials, Stefan over at CNC Kitchen has already done a great job right

        <h3>Specialty materials</h3>
        <span>ThermoPlastic Polyurethane</span>
        <h4>Better known by its acronym, TPU completes our 3D printing quartet.</h4>
        <p>
            TPU is essentially a plastic with rubber like characteristics which distinguishes it from the more common materials. It can be stretched and reverts to its 
            original form without deformation, it is also more resistant to abrasion.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can use TPU to print parts that need to bend or flex, extend or contract as part of normal operation, or during installation. This opens up a host of new 
            possibilities such as ergonomic covers for mechanical handles, or mounting brackets that need to absorb vibrations to reduce noise.
        </p>
        <p>
            One thing worth mentioning, the overall flexibility of the TPU part can be vastly controlled by the infill density used when printing. For example a cube with 
            lower infill will be squishy in the hand while a completely solid cube will be a lot firmer. 
        </p>
        <span>Polyvinyl Alcohol</span>
        <h4>PVA is the magician of the group.</h4>
        <p>
            With some models, overhaning sections need to be supported to make the print succeed. This can be accomplished with the same material that goes into the actual part 
            and later broken off. This however doesn't leave a good look on the model. 
        </p>
        <p>Or what if the support is inside a cavity that can't be accessed?</p>
        <p>
            PVA is unique in that it readily dissolves in water and can be used as the support material so that when the print is completed, a soak in water will dissolve all the 
            support material away. AKA magic.

        <p>To sum it up...</p>
        <ol>
            <li>         
                <p>
                    If your print is a vital mechanical part which will be undergoing significant loading or exposed to harsh environmental conditions, 
                    then PETG is definitely the material to choose.

            <li>
                <p>Artistically oriented objects or even mechanical but with minimal loads are however more suited to PLA.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>We would advise that you only choose ABS for high temperature applications.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If you wish you could design something out of rubber, you can. Just pick TPU.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You can combine these materials with PVA to ensure a dimensionaly perfect part. Just tell us about it</p>
